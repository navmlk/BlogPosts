####Configure AWS app & Azure AD single sign-on

For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Amazon Web Services (AWS) needs to be established.

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), assign the value of the user name in Azure AD as the value of the Username to establish the link relationship.
