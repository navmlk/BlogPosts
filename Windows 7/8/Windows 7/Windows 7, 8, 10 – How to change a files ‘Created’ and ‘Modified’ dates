If you need to change the ‘Created’ or ‘Modified’ dates on a file you have two options:

1.  Change the date and time on your computer, then save the file
2.  Use a third-party utility.


Using option two, my favourite utility is FileDate Changer – which is **completely FREE** and doesn’t require installation. Just download and run, even from a USB stick.

With it you can drop and drag a list of files from either your local computer, a network drive or UNC path then select the dates and hit **‘Change File Date’**.

You can download the utility from the official website here: www.nirsoft.net/utils/filedatech.html
